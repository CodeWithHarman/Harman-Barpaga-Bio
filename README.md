Hello, I’m Harman BARPAGA. I am a full stack developer and Javascript junkie :)

Bio:
	I am a qualified web developer, with an obsession for puzzles. I’m currently studying at Brock University, I am well on my way to being a multilingual programmer, having created apps in Javascript, React, and Java. Coding, after my parents, is the second greatest love in my life. It is a therapeutic and practical skill, allowing me to bring life to my crazy ideas while satisfying my need to puzzle.

Aside from my academic experience, I also have experience working in the field of computer science. Last summer, I worked as a Full-Stack developer at Civiconnect, a small Internet company in Beamsville, Ontario. I was responsible for maintaining and updating several of the company’s web applications and was the primary developer involved in the restructuring of an online solicitation application for the Niagara Benchlands Project. This internship gave me experience in working closely with end-users in developing solutions.

Apps:

1. Theme Change (light and dark mode) with React
2. Fitness website with React

currently working on few more..coming soon!!
